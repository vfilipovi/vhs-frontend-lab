### VHS

## Requirements

- install Docker on your machine and make sure you can run "docker -v" and "docker compose version" commands
- install NodeJS 16 and make sure you can run "node -v", "npm -v" and "yarn -v" commands

## Steps to start backend

To start the app, you should clone this repo to your local machine and do the following in your terminal:

- position yourself to project directory in your terminal of choice
- run "yarn" to install project dependencies
- run "docker compose up -d" to start the PostgreSQL VHS database
- run "yarn start:dev:seed" to start the app in development mode and also seed the database on startup (run "yarn start:dev" to start in development mode, but without database seeding)

You can control database seeding by setting the environment variable DB_SEED to 1 if you want to seed and 0 otherwise. So technically you don't necessarily need the yarn start:dev:seed script, it's there for convenience.

## Swagger UI (REST API specs)

You can find a Swagger UI page with the list of REST API routes you can call at http://localhost:3000/api when you start the app.
